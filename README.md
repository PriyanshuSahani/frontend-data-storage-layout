## My process

- Analysed the required layout to determine how I need to structure my HTML.
- Created the HTML, optimally using divs and section to simplify the CSS file.
- Finally, in style.css:
	- First setup the root variables
	- Applied the CSS reset
	- Built the layout(Positioning and sizing the divs)
	- Added colors and fonts.
	- Added media queries to make responsive

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Learnt how to use CSS custom properties to synchronize placement and sizing of various elements. 
- It was required as the design had absolute positioning to achieve the chat bubble. 
- The chat bubble itself is a composition of a rectangular box and a triangular svg hence it was challenging to get them to stay consistent.
